    Experiments:
        Counterfactual prompting
            type noones tried, even us
                give prompt and value you will be measuring
                allow CoT reasoning
                after termination, add a query about the measured value

    
    Attention visualization
    Noise injection
    How to involve controls
    Statistical Testing


    prompts:
        Look into template processor methods for prompt generation
            Can use a tag for a generation method to determine noise/CoT/etc insertion.
